# Open positions

**Note: We currently have a talented postdoc (2-3 years) to work with us in Fondation ARC funded project. Please [contact us](mailto:suman.mitra@inserm.fr") if youâ€™re interested to work on a high collaborative translational project involving CAR-T cells.**

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc

We are happy to support talented master and recent PhD graduates to apply for Ph.D and Postdoc fellowships in the group. Please contact us if would like to follow this route in joining the lab ([email](mailto:suman.mitra@inserm.fr")). 

### Bsc / Master students
Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
